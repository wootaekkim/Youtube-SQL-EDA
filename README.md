Exploratory Data Analysis of Youtube data From Kaggle Using MySQL

In this project I have done Exploratory Data analysis using Youtube Stattistics and Comment data From Kaggle.
Link to the data : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/advaypatil/youtube-statistics?resource=download&select=videos-stats.csv

First I imported data into MySQL database using Python Jupyter notebook. Process of doing so is shown in the **"Youtube Statistics and Comments data to MySQL.ipynb"** file above.

Then I performed Exploratory data analysis using SQL JOINs, CTEs and GROUP BY to look into the data. This is shown in **"Youtube_EDA.sql"** above
